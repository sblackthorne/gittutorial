#Hello world.

This is my very first attempt at learning GitHub. So far, I've learned an abundance of stuff that I am not certain I will retain and feel completely overwhelmed by...And I am LOVING it.

##Here is what I've done so far:

* how to create a repo in my terminal
* how to push data from my repo to GitHub
* what markdown language is, and shortcuts for converting it to HTML

Suddenly, it seems like I know more than I actually think I know, once I get out of my head and just do the work. *Do you know that feeling?*

>Now, how to use GitHub to work collaborative projects?

1. Find someone with whom I can collaborate on some work (probably in **Ruby**)
1. Invite them to work with a [#ruby](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ruby&src=typd) newbie
1. Create a working repository and allow both people access to it
1. Begin the project!

And with that, this daily log of my GitHub lesson is complete!
